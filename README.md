# 42 Cursus Project: Get_next_line

## Introduction

This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor. It will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.

## Makefile Commands

- `make/make all` - create library without bonus files
- `make clean` - delete mandatory (part 1 & 2) object files
- `make fclean` - delete mandatory object and binary files
- `make re` - delete mandatory object files, binary files, and create library without bonus files
